# Click-Manette // Cookie cliker

**The cookie clicker project was carried out in January 2023, during the 2nd month of becode's web development training.**

Cookie Clicker is a simple and addictive game in which the player clicks a button labeled "manette" in order to increase their score.  

The player starts with a score of 0 and can increase it by clicking the "manette" button.  
The player can also purchase various options (Price increases by 2x with each purchase) to temporarily increase their score, such as:  
•	X : Each click is worth 2 points for 30 seconds.   
•	Y : Each click is worth 4 points for 30 seconds.
•	Auto: Score increases by 10 every second for 30 seconds.  
•	Bonus: Score is multiplied by 2 with each click for 30 seconds.   
The player's progress is saved between game sessions.

## The Goal
Improve our JavaScript skills
Learn about incremental games
Improve our HTML and CSS skills

## Instructions
Step 1: Base structure

Write the base structure for the project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Within the HTML, put a click button which will increment a counter and a label initialised at 0 to display said counter.
Step 2: Prepare the JavaScript

In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.
Step 3: Increase the score

When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by 1, then display the current score inside the label.
Step 4: Make a multiplier

Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by two for example.
Step 5: Price of multiplier

The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.
Step 6: No credit

You can’t make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score. Think about updating the score display after a purchase.
Step 7: Display multiplier counter

Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth 5, then the button should display something like multiplier x5.
Step 8: Increase the cost

Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.
Step 9: Display the cost

In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the upgrade.
Step 10: Auto-clicker

Implement a new improvement to buy, the auto-click. As the name might suggest this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each x seconds.
Step 11: Bonus

Implement yet another improvement to buy, the bonus. It should grant the player a boost in score of 200% per click for 30 seconds. When purchased the player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.
Step 12: Deactivate the buttons

Make it so that, if the player doesn’t have the points to purchase a multiplier, an auto-click or an other bonus, he can’t.
Step 13: Make it pretty

Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra JavaScript.
